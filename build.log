Compiled with warnings.

[eslint] 
src/pages/admin_dashboard.tsx
  Line 30:6:   React Hook useCallback has an unnecessary dependency: 'checkAuthorized'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'checkAuthorized' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  Line 33:9:   The 'checkForMessages' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 70) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the definition of 'checkForMessages' in its own useCallback() Hook           react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  Line 352:3:  The 'loadUserProfiles' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 70) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the definition of 'loadUserProfiles' in its own useCallback() Hook           react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

src/pages/instructor_dashboard.tsx
  Line 79:6:  React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'checkForMessages', 'checkWithRoles', 'currentUserProfile.name', 'loadUserProfiles', and 'users'. Either include them or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

src/pages/qa-dashboard.tsx
  Line 17:10:  'editableContent' is assigned a value but never used                                                                                                                                                 @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  Line 18:9:   The 'editableElementIds' array makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 37) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'editableElementIds' in its own useMemo() Hook  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
